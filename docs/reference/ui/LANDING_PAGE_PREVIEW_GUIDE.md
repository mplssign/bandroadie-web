2. **Features Grid** - 4 feature cards (Rehearsals, Gigs, Calendar, Setlists)
3. **Value Proposition** - "Everything Your Band Needs — In One Place"
4. **Screenshots Carousel** - Interactive PageView showcasing app screens
5. **Download CTA** - App Store + Google Play (coming soon) buttons

### 🎨 Design Features

## 🧪 Local Preview Instructions

### Option 1: Flutter Web (Chrome) - Recommended
```bash
# Run on Chrome with hot reload (from project root)
flutter run -d chrome \
  --dart-define=SUPABASE_URL=https://nekwjxvgbveheooyorjo.supabase.co \
  --dart-define=SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key-here
# Or use .vscode/launch.json with dart-define values configured
```

**What to expect:**
- Landing page opens at `http://localhost:XXXX/`
- Hot reload enabled (press `r` in terminal)
- Full responsive testing via Chrome DevTools

**Test the flow:**
1. Landing page loads with hero section
2. Scroll through all 6 sections
3. Click "Use the Web App" → redirects to `/app` (login screen)
4. Click "Download on the App Store" → opens iOS App Store
5. Test responsive: DevTools > Toggle device toolbar (iPhone 14, iPad)

---

### Option 2: macOS Desktop App
```bash
# Run native macOS build
flutter run -d macos
```

**What to expect:**
- macOS window opens with landing page
- Native performance
- Good for testing desktop layout

**Note:** Landing page is only shown on Web builds. macOS will technically show it, but the intended flow is Web → Landing, Mobile → Direct to App.

---

### Option 3: Local Web Server (Production-like)
```bash
# Build production web bundle
flutter build web --release

# Serve locally (Python 3)
cd build/web
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

**What to expect:**
- Open browser to `http://localhost:8000`
- Production-optimized build (minified, tree-shaken)
- Slower rebuilds (no hot reload)
- Closest to deployed experience

## 🔧 Quick Fixes

### If landing page doesn't show
```bash
# Check routing
flutter run -d chrome --verbose

# Look for "Navigator" logs
# Should see: "Route '/' → LandingPage"
```

### If images don't load
```bash
# Verify assets in pubspec.yaml
grep -A5 "assets:" pubspec.yaml

# Should include: assets/images/
```

### If colors look wrong
Check `lib/app/theme/design_tokens.dart`:
- `AppColors.accent` = #BE123C (rose)
- `AppColors.scaffoldBg` = #0A0A0A (black)
